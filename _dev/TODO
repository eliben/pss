Preparing a new release
-----------------------

* Run all tests before packaging
* Make sure new version was updated everywhere appropriate
* Packaging done on Linux - run ``python setup.py build sdist``
* Untar the created ``dist/pss-x.y.tar.gz`` and make sure everything looks ok
* Create a virtual env for Python
* Use that virtual env executable to install the source tarball
* Run ``~/test/venv/bin/pss`` and see it's OK
* Run ``~/test/venv/bin/python <path to pss dir>`` and see it's OK (this tests
  module invocation with __main__.py)
* Now build with upload to send it to PyPi
* Test with pip install from some new virtualenv
