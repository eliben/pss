Introduction: what is pss?
--------------------------

You can think of **pss** as an enhanced **grep** designed to search inside source code files.
**pss** is very similar to the Perl **ack** tool (see
https://bitbucket.org/eliben/pss/wiki/PssAndAck).

Pre-requisites
--------------

**pss** needs only Python to run. It works with with Python versions 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2 on
Linux and Windows. Some testing was done on on Mac OS X and FreeBSD as well.

Installing
----------

When you unzip the source distribution, run::

    > python setup.py install

Alternatively, **pss** can be installed from PyPi (Python package index)::

    > pip install pss

Running without installing
--------------------------

**pss** supports direct invocation even without installing it. This may
be useful if you're on a machine without administrator rights, or want to
experiment with a source distribution of **pss**.

Just unzip the **pss** distribution into some directory. Let's assume its full
path is ``/path/to/pss``. You can now run::

    > /path/to/python /path/to/pss

And this will invoke **pss** as expected. This command can also be tied to an
alias or placed in a shell (or batch) script for convenience.

How to use it?
--------------

**pss** is meant to be executed from the command line. Running it with no arguments or with
``-h`` will print a detailed usage message. 

For some detailed usage examples, check out the 
Usage wiki page - https://bitbucket.org/eliben/pss/wiki/Usage.

License
-------

**pss** is open-source software. Its code is in the public domain. See the ``LICENSE``
file for more details.
